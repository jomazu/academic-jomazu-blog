I am an ardent technology enthusiast and Project Manager for [Magid Glove & Safety](https://www.magidglove.com/) - Americaâ€™s leading, family-owned (since 1946), Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) manufacturer.

Outside of work, programming, and web development, I like to travel and spend time with family. I enjoy reading, learning new skills (a committed lifelong learner), being outdoors in the Arizona sun, and staying fit.

This site was spawned from my desire to document, collect and share pieces of accumulated knowledge. It continues to be a work-in-progress!
