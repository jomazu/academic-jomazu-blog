## The Differences: Margin vs Markup

<br>
## Margin in Dollars ($)
`SP` = Selling Price  
`Cost` = Cost to Produce (i.e., Manufactured Cost *or* Cost purchased for)  

- `Margin` = `SP - Cost`  

<br>
## Margin in Percent (%)
Divide by Selling Price  

- `Margin %` = `(SP - Cost) / SP`

**Example:**  
```
SP = $10  
Cost = $5

% Margin = (10 - 5) / 10 
Margin = 50%
```

<br>
## Selling Price from Margin Percent (%)

If you know both of the following:  

- `% Margin`  
- `Cost`  

Then you can use the following formula to determine the Selling Price (SP):  

- `SP` = `Cost / (1 - % Margin)`

This can be useful if you have a **Target Margin** (the desired profit on each sale). Simply plug in your desired `% Margin` to see how your ultimate `SP` would fluctuate.

<br>
## Markup in Dollars ($)
In a dollar sense, Markup and Margin are exactly the same.  

However, if **percentages** or **decimals** are used, a 20% markup (on cost) is different than a 20% margin (on price). This is where things differ.  

<br>
## Markup in Percent (%)
Divide by Cost  

- `Markup %` = `(SP - Cost) / Cost`  

**Example:**  
```
SP = 10  
Cost = 5  

% Markup = (10 - 5) / 5
Markup = 100%
```

<br>
## Selling Price from Markup Percent (%)

If you know both of the following:  

- `% Markup`  
- `Cost`  

Then you can use the following formula to determine the Selling Price (SP):  

- `SP` = `Cost * (1 + Markup %)`

This can be useful if you have a **Target Markup** (the desired profit on each sale). Simply plug in your desired `Markup %` to see how your ultimate `SP` would fluctuate.
