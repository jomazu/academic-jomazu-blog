## The Three Lenses of Pricing 

<br>
#### Economics
  - `Cost` - what does it cost to serve your customers a particular product.
  - `Margin` - the profit that can be placed on top of the cost.
  - `Supply & Demand`
  - `Incentives` - what you give your customers to buy more volume, including discounts.  

#### Customers
  - `Value` - what value will your customers receive.
  - `Willingness to Pay` - what are your customers willing to pay.
  - `Customer Segments` - do you have different types of customer segments.
  - `Purchase Decisions` - how will your customers make decisions - i.e. how will they compare your products to other products.  

#### Competitors
  - `Next Best Alternative` - how does your product compare to the next best alternative.
  - `Market Prices` - what your competitors are charging.
  - `Market Share` - the portion of the market controlled by competitors.
  - `Industry Dynamics` - what is your competitions strategy.

<br>
## Overlap Between Lenses

#### I.
The first overlap is between **Economics** (Supply & Demand) and **Customers** (how customers value things differently). This overlap is about:  

- **Price Elasticity** - is the measure of how much your volume will depend on your price, and how much your customers value your product. Also, the measure of where your costs are, so that you can optimize the volume you want for the margins you expect to receive.

#### II.
The second overlap is between **Customers** (Customer Segments and where they come from) and **Competitors** (what they are offering). This overlap is about:  

- **Price Discrimination** - very often different competitors will tailor to different customer segments. It gives an indication about what you can do to discriminate price points between different customer segments.

#### III.
The third overlap is between **Economics** and **Competitors**. This overlap is about:  

- **Game Theory** - a discipline that tries to help companies decide whether or not to match competitors prices. It considers every market as a gain, where companies go against each other on an ongoing basis. 

<br>
It helps to determine...  

- What the optimum price points are
- Where you know that competitors are going to react to your price changes
- Whether to price up or to price down

<br>
## How Lenses Intersect in Middle

**Pricing Strategy Optimization** considers how the three lenses intersect and work together to determine an optimal pricing strategy. This overlap in the middle pulls everything together to make a pricing decision that will take into account all of the three lenses:  

- What is your cost  
- What do your customers want  
- What are your competitors doing  

If you know how to balance these three forces, you will know how to set your price ideally and will maximize your profits!
