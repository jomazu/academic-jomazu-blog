## About 
Developed by Google, [Dart](https://dart.dev) is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform. Dart powers [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), Google's open-source UI toolkit for beautiful, natively compiled (iOS, Android) apps for [mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web), and [desktop](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Desktop-shells) from a single codebase.

Dart...

- Is a terse, strongly-typed, object-oriented language.
- Will feel familiar if you have experience with languages like Swift, C#, Java or JavaScript.
- Compiles to ARM & x64 machine code for mobile, desktop, and backend. Or compiles to JavaScript for the web.
- Supports both JIT (just-in-time) and AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation.
  - JIT code is continuously recompiled directly on the device, allowing hot reload.
  - AOT code is compiled directly to native ARM code, leading to fast startup and predictable performance.
- Is performant in development and in production.

## Flutter's Reactive Framework
[Widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro) are the foundation of Flutter apps. A widget is a description of part of a user interface. Nearly everything is a widget, written in Dart.
