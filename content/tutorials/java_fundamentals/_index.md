The Java Programming Language is a gerneral-purpose, concurrent, strongly-typed, class-based object-oriented language. It is normally compiled to the bytecode instruction set and binary format defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

***Program***
> A Computer Program is a List of Instructions given to a computer on how to perform a given task.

***Methods***
> Methods are Named Blocks of Instructions. For instance, a List of Instructions for changing a tire can be broken down into four (4) Named Blocks of Intructions (Methods):
1. Park Car
2. Get Tools
3. Change Tire
4. Return Tools

> Each Method contains specific steps (details) for completing a task. These details are wrapped in the Method. Thus, Methods are used to organize a long list of instructions in a Computer Program into manageable Blocks.

> The starting point in every Java Program is the **Main Method**, which is where you would **Call** your Methods. For example, in the changing a tire program, the Methods for Park Car, Get Tools, Change Tire, or Return Tools would be **Called** within the **Main Method**. A Method is a container of Instructions.

***Class***
> A Class is a place where you define your Methods, it is a container of Methods.
